Dividend Bonding Curve

This repo contains an example of a dividend bonding curve - a token contract
based on bonding curve technology (where the token can be bought/sold for a 
deterministic price based on current supply), where every buy/sell has a 10% fee
sent to a dividend contract, and where shares of that dividend contract are issued
per buy (not sell) with a halving multiplier to award/incentivise early buyers
